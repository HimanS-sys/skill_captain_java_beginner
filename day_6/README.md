# Assignment 6

Write a Java program that uses a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
Then, write another program that uses a while loop to print out the even numbers between 1 and 20.
Finally, write a program that uses a do-while loop to prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10, and keeps prompting until a valid number is entered.
Once a valid number is entered, the program should print out a message that says "You entered [number]."
